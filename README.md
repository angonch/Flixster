# Project 2 - Flixster

Flixster shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: 15 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **scroll through current movies** from the Movie Database API
* [X] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
* [X] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  * [X] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
  * [X] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)
* [X] Allow user to view details of the movie including ratings and popularity within a separate activity

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

* [X] Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
* [X] Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using [Glide transformations](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#transformations)
* [X] Apply the popular [View Binding annotation library](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-ViewBinding) to reduce boilerplate code.
* [X] Allow video trailers to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView from the details screen.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

A challenge I faced while making this app was understanding how information is passed between activities
using Parcels, so I carefully read the flow of the code to understand what information was needed
and why Parcel was used to wrap objects Activities cannot read like my Movie class. It was also challenging
to understand the ViewBinding simplification, and I am not sure whether I implemented it in all the
correct spots (for example I did not use it in the adapter class) Another challenge was trying to implement
the YouTube player inside the detail view, because it took me a while to understand where the API call
and listener should be made to play the video. Finally, I also played around with UI in this project. I discovered
that you can make an attributes file and that actions can be added to the action bar with a menu directory.
